## Goal:
The project aims to provide a tool capable of responding to inquiries and frequent questions about a topic of interest to the concerned party with very accurate answers, such as responding to inquiries about specific courses and accessing information from the unstructured database by linking chatGPT with Roberta, and this will reduce the burden on the staff responsible for this task.

## Dataset:
We used the camps set up by Tuwaiq Academy during this month


## 

|    | Advantages |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1| The tool can be used to connect any database to any party   |
| 2|Use Roberta model for embedding data instead of using chat gpt's embedding because of its limitations  |
| 3|It can be used as a tool and linked to any project through an API  |
